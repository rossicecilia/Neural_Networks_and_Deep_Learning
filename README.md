# Image Recoloring using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
Final Project for the Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course. 

Image recoloring is the task of assigning RGB values to grayscale pixels.
Since this is an ill posed problem (multiple colored images can produce the same grayscale image) it can be tackled by a generative framework that can produce an image with high likelyhood.
